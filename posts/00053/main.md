We may have been invented a teaching algorithm for robots. This algorithm will be published at the conference of Japan Robotics Society in September. The following movies were recorded with this algorithm.
<ul>
 	<li>In the following demonstration, we firstly controlled the robot three laps by hand. The robot learns how to move in this maze and makes it.</li>

<ul>
 	<li>The robot learns two kinds of simple motion. Though the motions are simple, the robot must take sequential motion even if the robot can't distinguish whether it must go forward or backward from sensor readings. In the second motion, the robot can restart the motion after interruptions smoothly. The robot sometimes stops for several seconds since it has learned the resting state at the end of the training (This problem should be removed and it will be easy.).</li>
